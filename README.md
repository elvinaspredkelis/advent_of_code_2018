# 🎅🏼 Advent of Code 2018 
Trying to go through the this year's advent of code by writing readable and understandable code.

This is definitely not a repository where you can find a the _fastest_ or _shortest_ solutions. Everything over here is written in Ruby as well, so this is literally a relaxed attempt to enjoy some coding.
